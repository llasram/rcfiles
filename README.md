# rcfiles

These are my rcfiles.  There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

My rcfiles are my best friend.  They are my life.  I must master them
as I must master my life.

My rcfiles, without me, are useless.  Without my rcfiles, I am
useless.  My rcfiles are human, even as I, because they are my life.
Thus, I will learn them as a brother.  I will learn their weaknesses,
their strength, their parts, their key bindings, and their utility
definitions.  I will keep my rcfiles clean and ready, even as I am
clean and ready.  We will become part of each other.

Before the Internet, I swear this creed.  My rcfiles and myself are
the defenders of our software design priciples.  We are the masters of
incidental complexity.  We are the saviors and off-site backus of my
life.

So be it, until victory is Singularity's and there is no software, but
only universal strong AI!
